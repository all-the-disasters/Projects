## Description

This repository contains my solutions to projects from [Karan Goel's repository](https://github.com/karan/Projects) solved for the purpose of 
gaining fluency in python basics again and trying out new ways to go around simple problems.

All the projects are solved in python 3. Each file corresponds to the category of projects, all of which can be opened 
with ***project opener.py***. Opening files with solutions separately is only for testing purposes.
